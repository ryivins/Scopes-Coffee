# Coffee & Beverages

## Overview
This page outlines **Coffee & Beverages** for Scopes Coffee as part of our _Product & Services_ category. It provides practical decisions and standards so policies can be executed consistently by staff.

### What will our core coffee menu include?
Espresso, americano, cappuccino, latte, mocha, batch brew, pour‑over, cold brew, and loose‑leaf teas.

### Will we offer specialty seasonal drinks?
Yes—quarterly features tied to local roasters, flavors, and scene events (e.g., release‑show collabs).

### How will we ensure consistency in taste and quality?
Dial‑in logs, water spec management, scales/timers, and recipe cards per drink; calibrate grinders each shift.

### How will we handle dietary needs (decaf, plant-based milk)?
Offer decaf, oat/almond milks, sugar‑free options; clearly label allergens.

### How do we price beverages competitively yet profitably?
Target 20–25% COGS; tier pricing by size and milk; bundle with show tickets for value.
