## Overview
This page outlines **Food Program** for Scopes Coffee as part of our _Product & Services_ category. It provides practical decisions and standards so policies can be executed consistently by staff.

### Which baked goods and snacks will we offer?
Rotating pastries, cookies, savory hand pies, and simple sandwiches; late‑night soft pretzels for shows.

### Will food be made in-house or sourced locally?
Begin with local bakery partners for reliability; pilot one in‑house signature item once volume supports it.

### How do we meet dietary needs (vegan, gluten-free)?
Labeling, dedicated tongs, and at least one vegan and one gluten‑free option daily.

### How do we manage freshness and waste?
Par sheets, end‑of‑day discounts, donation partners, and accurate sales forecasting.

### What seasonal or rotating options can we introduce?
Monthly features tied to roaster collabs and local produce (e.g., apple hand pies in fall).
