# Community Engagement

## Overview
This page outlines **Community Engagement** for Scopes Coffee as part of our _Customer & Community Experience_ category. It provides practical decisions and standards so policies can be executed consistently by staff.

### How will we collaborate with local schools, art groups, or charities?
Student showcases, art hangs, benefit nights with transparent donations, and mentorship workshops.

### What programs can encourage student or artist participation?
Discount nights, zine tables, internship credits, and gallery‑night tie‑ins.

### Can we sponsor or co-host community events?
Yes—co‑branded series with community partners and rotating curators.

### How will we support local musicians beyond just shows?
Provide rehearsal hours, media days, and mini‑grants from a portion of merch sales.

### What role can customers play in shaping programming?
Quarterly surveys, suggestion box, and an open programming forum every semester.
