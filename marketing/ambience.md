# Visual Design & Ambience

## Overview
This page outlines **Visual Design & Ambience** for Scopes Coffee as part of our _Brand & Marketing_ category. It provides practical decisions and standards so policies can be executed consistently by staff.

### What will the shop’s layout and furniture look like?
Modular seating with power access, ADA paths, and a compact stage zone.

### How do we balance a cozy café with a show-ready venue?
Roll‑away fixtures, cable management, and acoustic treatment that doubles as décor.

### What role will art and murals play in the design?
Rotating walls curated by local artists; no permanent gatekeeping of styles.

### How will lighting and décor shift between day and night?
Warm task lighting by day; dimmable scenes and stage washes by night.

### What sensory elements (smell, music, visuals) define the experience?
Fresh‑ground coffee, low‑volume ambient playlists by day, controlled SPL and visuals at night.
