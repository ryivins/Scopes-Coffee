# Brand Identity

## Overview
This page outlines **Brand Identity** for Scopes Coffee as part of our _Brand & Marketing_ category. It provides practical decisions and standards so policies can be executed consistently by staff.

### What values and story define Scopes Coffee?
Belonging, transparency, and creativity—born from DIY scenes that needed a safer, reliable home.

### What aesthetic do we want (visuals, interior design, vibe)?
Warm wood + industrial details; hand‑drawn typography; show posters; plants and practical seating.

### What tone of voice will we use in communication?
Down‑to‑earth, respectful, and clear; no pretension, no gatekeeping.

### How do we ensure consistency across brand touchpoints?
Brand kit: colors, type, logo usage, photo style, and safe‑space wording; single source in the repo.

### What makes our brand different from typical cafés or venues?
Dual identity executed with integrity—specialty coffee standards alongside community‑first heavy music.
